# Spa-tify

This app, is the result of the joining effort of 7 students from #Henry's full-stack web developer bootcamp. It's mainly a platform to gather esthetic service providers with esthetic service users. It's a place where local offer meets local demand for a premium home-delivery service. Some of the services offered go from hair and beard cuts to nail services, to massages and so on.

The group members of this project are:
* Abuaf Daniel
* Buttazzoni Eugenio
* Cadena Leandro
* De Giorgi Gabriel
* Lozada Ignacio
* Martinez Mario
* Pintos Emiliano

We intend to make this app scalable but with the main goal of presenting it as a non-traditional e-commerce site with its typical features, a login/logout, a shopping cart and different ways to sort/filter products/services.

Some of the technologies used for this app are:
Programming:
* JavaScript
* TypeScript
* React
* Redux
* HTML
* CSS
* Express.js
* Node.js
* Material-UI

Project Management:
* Trello
